# Collection of possible todos

These are an unsorted collection of thoughts by others or myself and may or may not get done depending ...


## Comparing

- When comparing, I suggest writing the log file with the
  the list of glyphs found only in the comparison font. That way, people
  developing a font who want to have equal coverage can easily see what
  glyphs they are missing. Since you are already discovering the
  information, why not log it ...


- Also, if there are first-font-only symbols (maybe not in
  this case -- is there a way to get a textual list of the differing code
  points?), I'd suggest trying an open box (cf. the shaded box for
  second-font-only).
