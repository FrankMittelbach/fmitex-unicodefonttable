# The unicodefonttable package

-----

This package produces font tables for unicode fonts as well as for
8bit fonts.  The table layout can be adjusted in various ways
including restricting the range of output to show only a portion of a
specific font.

To quickly produce a one-off table there is a stand-alone version
`unicodefont.tex` that asks you a few questions and then generates the
table --- somewhat similar to `nfssfont.tex` for 8-bit fonts.


The official package source can be found at:
